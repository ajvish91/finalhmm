Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions about housing and house- holds. In 1961 the scope of the question was wider than before, because of the great use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and to local authori- ties. As before, the record made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residential premises and temporary places of abode, and all households occupying them, as the basis of the enumeration is the household schedule.
