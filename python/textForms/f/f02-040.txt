As a result, the Glasgow Retirement Council came into being in April, 1958, with Dr. Andrew Hood as chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. The Council has active committees on Education and Preparation for Retirement, and on Occupa- tional Centres. The former consists of representatives from the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department; the Workers' Educational Association; the University Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments of psychology, education and so- cial science; the trades unions; and the Regional Hospital Board, together with an industrial medical officer and a Medical Officer of Health.
