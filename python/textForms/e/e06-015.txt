The joint evidence of echo-sounders and fishing gear leads to an overall though some- what dim picture. The details are harder still to see. Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance, shoals that gather at the Knoll or other banks are most of them going to travel a hundred miles farther south before they spawn. Some will spawn at the Hinder banks, which are half-way; and it may be that in their southerly march the herring will spawn wherever the suitable gravelly bottom soil coincides with their final ripeness.
