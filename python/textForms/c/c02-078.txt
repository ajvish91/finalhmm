It has a great look of speed and technical fun about it, of enormous cinematic enjoy- ment, and above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has that air of improvisation, as of off-the-cuff living, that once seemed so new and so attractive. The story (not that the story, in the sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of situation and movement it matters a lot) is that of a man on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who spends a few days with an American girl (Jean Seberg) who is bearing his child (though paternity is always a rather dubious business among the new wave): an affair that remains spiritually unconsummated as they move on to the final betrayal.
