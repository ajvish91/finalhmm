The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed for ten days and showed no abnormalities. Any impurity in the lead fraction must have been well below one percent. Some separated lead-210 was used to make reference standards and as a tracer in recovery experiments. There was no significant difference between these results and those obtained using the original lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical Centre which we concluded was radiochemically pure.
