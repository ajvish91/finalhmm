Rosenquist (4) showed that minute quantities of lead can be isolated from large vol- umes of solution by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium sulphate. Lead and strontium form mixed crystals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate is almost completely recovered even if precipitation of the strontium sulphate is incomplete. Using ten milligrams of lead carrier and six hundred milligrams of strontium per liter, more than 95 experiment.
