Table 1 shows the decontamination factors obtained experimentally for ten radionu- clides, accompanied in two instances by radioactive daughters. The decontamination factor falls below 104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95 with their daughters in the first stage, i.e. the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-210 daughter. When the second stage (the bismuth phosphate source) is completed, the decontam- ination factors are exceptionally high.
