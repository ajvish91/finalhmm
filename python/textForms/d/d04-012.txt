The word Shamir was used as a personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew word &quot;SHAMIR&quot; means guarded or preserved. Therefore, the real man, who regards him- self as insignificant, as the prayer says: &quot;What am I? A worm&quot;, he is the Shamir and such a man fulfils the Shmah, loves the Lord God with all his heart, and with all his soul and with all his might and studies the word of God.
